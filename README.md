# SQL EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT

---

## üìä Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL Server. The goal is to analyze structured data from the previously built [data warehouse project](https://github.com/k178412/sql-data-warehouse-project/tree/main) and extract meaningful business insights.

The analysis explores different angles such as date trends, customer performance, product sales, cumulative patterns, segmentation, and more.

Two detailed reports **Customers Report** and **Products Report** highlight key findings related to customer behaviour and product performance.

## üîç Key Analytical Areas
Different types of analysis performed during the project. Each analytical area is designed to explore the data from a specific angle, whether it‚Äôs identifying top performers, tracking trends over time, or segmenting customers and products for deeper insights.  

The project includes:
- **Database Exploration** - Understanding the structure of the database, including schema, tables, and relationships.
- **Date Range Exploration** - Finding trends based on order timelines.
- **Magnitude & Ranking Analysis** - Measuring total sales and identifying top-performing customers or products.
- **Performance Analysis** - Comparing individual performance against total and average metrics.
- **Change Over Time** - Observing sales and purchase behaviour over time.
- **Cumulative Analysis** - Calculating running totals and moving averages to understand long-term trends.
- **Part-to-Whole Analysis** - Understanding contributions of individual entities to overall business metrics.
- **Data Segmentation** ‚Äì Grouping customers and products for deeper insights.
