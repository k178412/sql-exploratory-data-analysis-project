# SQL-EXPLORATORY-DATA-ANALYSIS-PROJECT
This project demonstrates different analytical techniques such as changes over time, cumulative, performance, part to whole analysis.

📌# Project Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL, aimed at uncovering insights from a structured database. 
The analysis covers multiple dimensions, including date range exploration, magnitude analysis, ranking, change over time, cumulative trends, performance evaluation, part-to-whole relationships, and data segmentation.
Two key reports- Customers Report and Products Report; compile all essential information into a single place for better business understanding.

#🔍 Key Analytical Areas
The project includes in-depth SQL based analysis across various perspectives:
- Database Structure Exploration – Understanding schema, dimensions, and relationships.
- Date Range Exploration – Finding trends based on order timelines.
- Magnitude Analysis – Quantifying total sales, purchases, and other metrics.
- Ranking & Performance – Identifying top-performing customers and products.
- Change Over Time – Observing sales and purchase behavior shifts over periods.
- Cumulative & Segmentation Analysis – Tracking aggregated patterns and customer/product categorization.
- Part-to-Whole Analysis – Measuring contributions of individual entities to overall business metrics.
  
#📊 Reports
##1️⃣ Customers Report
Includes:
- Customer demographics (age, segmentation, engagement)
