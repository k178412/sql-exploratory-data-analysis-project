# SQL-EXPLORATORY-DATA-ANALYSIS-PROJECT
This project demonstrates different analytical techniques such as changes over time, cumulative, performance, part to whole analysis.

---

## Project Overview
This project is all about exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL. The goal is to analyze structured data and extract useful insights. The analysis covers different aspects, including date range exploration, ranking, changes over time, cumulative trends, performance tracking, part-to-whole relationships, and data segmentation.

Two reports- **Customers Report** and **Products Report** bring together key findings to help understand customer behavior and product performance.

## Key Analytical Areas
The project includes:
- **Database Exploration** - Understanding database, schema, dimensions, and relationships.
- **Date Range Exploration** - Finding trends based on order timelines.
- **Magnitude & Ranking Analysis** - Measuring total sales and identifying top customers.
- **Performance Analysis** - Evaluating performance of customers/products by comparing them with total sales, avg sales etc.
- **Change Over Time** - Observing sales and purchase behavior over time.
- **Cumulative Analysis** - Observing aggregated patterns such as running total or moving average.
- **Part-to-Whole Analysis** - Understanding contributions to overall business metrics.
- **Data Segmentation** â€“ Grouping customers and products for deeper insights.

- Customers segmentation
- Valuable KPIs (Time since last purchase, average order value)
  
### Products Report
Includes:
- Products basic info (product name, category)
- Products segmentation
- Metrics (total sales, total sold quantity)
- Valuable KPIs (months since last sale, average order value)
