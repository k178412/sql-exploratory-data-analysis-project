# SQL EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT

---

## üìä Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL Server. The goal is to analyze structured data from the previously built [data warehouse project](https://github.com/k178412/sql-data-warehouse-project/tree/main) and extract meaningful business insights.

The analysis explores different angles such as date trends, customer performance, product sales, cumulative patterns, segmentation, and more.

Two detailed reports **Customers Report** and **Products Report** highlight key findings related to customer behaviour and product performance.

## üîç Key Analytical Areas
Different types of analysis performed during the project. Each analytical area is designed to explore the data from a specific angle, whether it‚Äôs identifying top performers, tracking trends over time, or segmenting customers and products for deeper insights.  

The project includes:
- [**Database Exploration**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/01-database-exploration.sql) - Explored the structure of the database, including schema, tables, and columns using ```Information Schema```.
- [**Dimension Exploration**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/02-dimensions-exploration.sql) - Explored different dimensions within the dataset such as different countries customer come from, available product categories.
- [**Date Range Exploration**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/03-daterange-exploration.sql) - Explored date boundaries in the dataset such as finding first and last order date to see how many year of sales are available.
- [**Measure Exploration**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/04-measures-exploration.sql) - Calculated key metrics such as total sales, total orders, average price, customers who placed an order to support deeper analysis.
- [**Magnitude Analysis**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/05-magnitude-analysis.sql) - Analyzed key metrics grouped by different dimensions such as total products by category, total revenue generated by each customer.
- [**Ranking Analysis**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/06-ranking-analysis.sql) - Identified top performing products by revenue, helping highlight the ones that bring in most of the sales.
- [**Change Over Time**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/07-change-over-time-analysis.sql) - Calculated annual sales to observe how sales changed year over year to track business growth.
- [**Cumulative Analysis**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/08-cumulative-analysis.sql) - Calculated running totals for sales to visualize growth over time and to understand the accumulation of revenue across the timeline.
- [**Performance Analysis**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/09-performance-analysis.sql) - Compared yearly total sales for each subcategories against average sales and previous sales to evaluate individual performance.
- [**Part-to-Whole Analysis**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/10-part-to-whole-analysis.sql) - Analyzed how different product categories contribute to total sales to identify the most impactful segment.
- [**Data Segmentation**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/11-data-segmentation.sql) ‚Äì Grouped customers based on order history & spending amount and products into cost ranges, enabling more targeted insights.

Includes:
- Basic customer details (name, age)
- Customer segmentation (VIP, Regular, New)
- Transactional details (total orders, total sales)
- Key KPIs (time since last purchase, average order value)
  
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ [Products Report](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/03-final-reports/02-products-report.sql)
