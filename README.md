# SQL EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT

---

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL Server. The goal is to analyze structured data from the previously built [data warehouse project](https://github.com/k178412/sql-data-warehouse-project/tree/main) and extract meaningful business insights.

The analysis explores different angles such as date trends, customer performance, product sales, cumulative patterns, segmentation, and more.

Two detailed reports **Customers Report** and **Products Report** highlight key findings related to customer behaviour and product performance.

## 🚀 Setup & Usage 
Start by launching SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and follow these steps to setup the environment before running any analysis queries.  

**Directory** - ```scripts/01-setup/```
- [**01-init-database.sql**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/01-setup/01-init-database.sql) - Creates the ```DataWarehouseAnalytics``` database and ```Gold``` schema. Run this first.
  
- [**02-ddl-gold.sql**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/01-setup/02-ddl-gold.sql) - Creates tables (```dim_customers```, ```dim_products```, ```fact_sales```) inside the ```Gold``` schema.
  
- [**03-load-gold.sql**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/01-setup/03-load-gold.sql) - Loads data into the tables using ```Bulk Insert```.
  > ⚠️ Make sure to update the file paths of [source files](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/tree/main/datasets) in the script to match your local system.

Once setup is complete, you can start running analysis queries from the [02-eda-queries](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/tree/main/scripts/02-eda-queries) folder.

## 🔍 Key Analytical Areas
Various types of analysis were performed throughout the project. Each analytical area focuses on a specific aspect of the data whether it's identifying top performers, uncovering time-based trends, or segmenting customers and products for deeper insights.

Analyses include:
- [**Database Exploration**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/01-database-exploration.sql) - Explored the structure of the database, including schema, tables, and columns using ```Information Schema```.
- [**Dimension Exploration**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/02-dimensions-exploration.sql) - Explored different dimensions within the dataset such as different countries customer come from, available product categories.
- [**Date Range Exploration**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/03-daterange-exploration.sql) - Explored date boundaries in the dataset such as finding first and last order date to see how many year of sales are available.
- [**Measure Exploration**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/04-measures-exploration.sql) - Calculated key metrics such as total sales, total orders, average price, customers who placed an order to support deeper analysis.
- [**Magnitude Analysis**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/05-magnitude-analysis.sql) - Analyzed key metrics grouped by different dimensions such as total products by category, total revenue generated by each customer.
- [**Ranking Analysis**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/06-ranking-analysis.sql) - Identified top performing products by revenue, helping highlight the ones that bring in most of the sales.
- [**Change Over Time**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/07-change-over-time-analysis.sql) - Calculated annual sales to observe how sales changed year over year to track business growth.
- [**Cumulative Analysis**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/08-cumulative-analysis.sql) - Calculated running totals for sales to visualize growth over time and to understand the accumulation of revenue across the timeline.
- [**Performance Analysis**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/09-performance-analysis.sql) - Compared yearly total sales for each subcategories against average sales and previous sales to evaluate individual performance.
- [**Part-to-Whole Analysis**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/10-part-to-whole-analysis.sql) - Analyzed how different product categories contribute to total sales to identify the most impactful segment.
- [**Data Segmentation**](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/02-eda-queries/11-data-segmentation.sql) – Grouped customers based on order history & spending amount and products into cost ranges, enabling more targeted insights.
  ```sql
  --Segment products into cost ranges and count how many products fall in each segment.
  with cost_segments_cte as(
  select
  	product_name,
  	cost,
  	case when cost < 100 then 'below 100'
         when cost between 100 and 500 then '100-500'
  	     when cost between 501 and 1000 then '501-1000'
  	     when cost between 1001 and 2000 then '1001-2000'
  	     else 'above 2001'
  	end as cost_segments
  from gold.dim_products
  )
  select
  	cost_segments,
  	count(*) as prdcts_in_sgmnt
  from cost_segments_cte
  group by cost_segments
  order by prdcts_in_sgmnt desc;
  ```

## 📜 Reports
The project is summarized into two main reports: one focusing on customer behavior, and the other on product performance. These reports bring together key metrics and KPIs, and can be further be used for analytics or querying purpose.

### 1️⃣ [Customers Report](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/03-final-reports/01-customers-report.sql)
Includes:
- Basic customer details (name, age)
- Customer segmentation (VIP, Regular, New)
- Transactional details (total orders, total sales)
- Key KPIs (time since last purchase, average order value)
  
### 2️⃣ [Products Report](https://github.com/k178412/sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project/blob/main/scripts/03-final-reports/02-products-report.sql)

## 🧠 Key Findings
This analysis helped uncovering several insights, including:

- **Older Customers Drive the Most Orders**  
  Customers aged 50 and above accounted for a majority of total orders (66%), while younger customers (30–39) contributed only 1%.
  
  **Query:**
  ```sql  
  with cte as(
  select
    age_group,
    sum(total_orders) as total_orders,
    sum(sum(total_orders)) over() as overall_orders
  from report_customers
  group by age_group
  )
  select
    *,
    cast((cast(total_orders as decimal)/overall_orders) * 100 as decimal(10,1)) as percent_of_overall_orders
  from cte
  order by percent_of_overall_orders desc;
  ```
  **Result:**
  | Age Group | Total Orders | Overall Orders | Percent of Overall Orders |
  |-----------|--------------|----------------|---------------------------|
  | Above 50  | 18,245       | 27,659         | 66.0%                     |
  | 40–49     | 9,132        | 27,659         | 33.0%                     |
