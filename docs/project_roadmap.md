# Project Roadmap Documentation

## Overview:
This project roadmap outlines the structured approach for data analytics, covering both Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Advanced Analytics.

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA focuses on understanding the dataset through different perspectives:

- Database Exploration – Reviewing tables and columns for structure.
- Dimensions Exploration – Identifying distinct values in categorical fields.
- Date Exploration – Analyzing time-based aspects.
- Measures Exploration – Examining key metrics such as sales and order counts.
- Magnitude Analysis – Understanding measures across dimensions.
- Ranking Analysis – Identifying top and bottom performers.
  
### 2. Advanced Analytics
Advanced techniques aim to derive deeper insights and business patterns:

- Change Over Time Analysis – Tracking trends and variations.
- Cumulative Analysis – Evaluating cumulative metrics like running totals.
- Performance Analysis – Measuring product or customer performance against averages.
- Part to Whole Analysis – Understanding proportional contributions in sales.
- Data Segmentation – Categorizing entities like customers or products.
- Reporting – Generating meaningful reports for business intelligence.

This roadmap serves as a guide for conducting thorough data analysis, ensuring a well-organized approach to insights and reporting.
